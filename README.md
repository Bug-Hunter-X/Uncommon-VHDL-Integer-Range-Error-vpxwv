This repository demonstrates a subtle error in VHDL code related to the declaration of integer signals and their ranges.  The `buggy_counter.vhd` file contains the flawed code, exhibiting unexpected behavior due to a mismatch in range specification. The `fixed_counter.vhd` file provides the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of consistent type definitions in VHDL for robust and predictable designs.
